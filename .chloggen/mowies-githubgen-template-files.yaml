  This feature allows maintainers to have custom content in addition to the component lists and others in their CODEOWNERS and ALLOWLIST files.
  Magic delimiter strings need to be added to CODEOWNERS and ALLOWLIST files fot githubgen to fill in the content.
  Use `# Start/End components list`, `# Start/End distribution list` and `# Start/End unmaintained components list` in your CODEOWNERS file.
  Use `# Start/End deprecated components list` and `# Start/End unmaintained components list` in your ALLOWLIST file.
  Also, issue template files need to be updated and use `# Start/End components list` to fill in the component list.
